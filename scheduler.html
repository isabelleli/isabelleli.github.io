                 As someone who is historically indecisive, it comes as no surprise that I would be the type of person
                 with three to four possible class schedules for a semester. However, what I found incredibly frustrating
                 in my first two semesters of college was that there was no tool to easily add Wellesley courses on a calendar.
                 Wellesley only has a <a href="https://courses.wellesley.edu/" target="_blank">course browser</a>, which provided
                 a listing of all the classes offered at a certain semester.
                 <!-- I distinctly remember (and I still have these files)
                 using Google sheets to create several possible schedules, which became frustrating very quickly (partially because
                 Wellesley's courses are offered at the strangest times - for ex: 11:10 AM - 12:20 PM). -->
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 The idea of a course scheduler for Wellesley came about in my CS 230 (Data Structures) class, where some teammates
                 and I created a version of a scheduler using the Java Graphical User Interface. The end result was incredibly clunky
                 and not acccessible to general students who may want to use this tool.
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 In Summer 2017, I decided to create a web version of a course scheduler, as a way to learn new front-end development
                 skills and to challenge myself. I used <strong>ReactJS</strong> for the front-end and scraped data off of the course
                 catalog using the <strong>Selenium</strong> library in <strong>Python</strong>.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2>Scraping with Selenium</h2>
              <p>
                <div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/scraper.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                To write my scripts for scraping, I used <strong>jupyter notebooks</strong>, a tool I discovered during my summer research experience at Wellesley
                (and fell in love with).
                <br />
                <br />
                Although scraping the information, parsing it, and storing everything into a JSON file only took a day or so, it took me a while to
                figure out how to parse the data. Some difficulties I ran into include: parsing alternative Wednesday classes (some Economics
                classes have regular class periods on Monday and Thursdays but will have an occasional Wednesday class) and generally parsing the
                days of the week and times that a class is offered on.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the future, I would love to talk with the administration about getting access to a database of the courses (I have plans to
                talk with the Registrar in Spring 2018). While running the scraping script is a quick process, it isn't a sustainable
                solution.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2>Front-End Work</h2>
              <p>
                Like I said in the summary, I used <strong>ReactJS</strong> to code the front-end portion. This was my first time using
                ReactJS, which was interesting to learn in the span of a week. (Why React? - My friend told me about how cool and useful
                it is so I just decided to try it out.)
                <br />
                <br />
                I divided the scheduler into a couple main components - a <strong>courses</strong> component that controlled the entire scheduler,
                a <strong>search</strong> component, and a <strong>calendar</strong> component.
                <br />
                <br />
                The courses component holds a list of currently selected courses. Based on that list, it passes a list of filtered classes
                to the search component (the filtering is to prevent users from selecting two courses which happen at the same time).
                <br />
                The search component, as the name suggests, consists of the search interface and also updates the list of currently selected
                courses.
                <br />
                Finally, the calendar component creates class div elements and their respective pop-ups (which hold information such as
                the professor teaching the class, the times it's available, and the full name of the course) and adds them onto the calendar.
                <br />
                <br />
                Some challenges I ran into included: organizing my ideas (and organizing the React components), handling time conflicts, and
                styling the actual calendar and the course blocks.
                <br />
                Furthermore, since I never used ReactJS before and completed the project in a week, I missed many nuances of React
                which would have made my code better. I plan on investing time over Winter 2018 to properly learning React and updating
                the course scheduler for registration in Spring 2018. I would also like to add more features such as being able to add your
                own courses. I hope to update this page in Spring 2018 with all my additions!
              </p>
